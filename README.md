# API-Integration
Script used to integrate Abios API with a database

**Project Description**: This is a JavaScript script that integrates data from *Abios Esports API* into the *Stream Hatchet* database. The script consists of several functions that inserts API data, such as tournament, match, and streaming information, into the database.

Some code from the real script has been redacted for privacy and security. In order to run this script, you will need a subscription to Abios API and a database with a similar structure to *Stream Hatchet's*.

This is an independent script, affiliated with *Stream Hatchet*. The project implementation is mine, and all code is written by me, using knowledge obtained by the University of Maryland and independent studies. The concept of this project was designed by a team at *Stream Hatchet*.
